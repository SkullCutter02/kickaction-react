              Kick Action connects studentsâ€™ passions in the martial arts, digital arts, filmmaking,
              engineering, and technology to democratise self-learned spiritual and social empowerment for
              marginalised communities. Notably, Kick Action initiated the first student-led self defence
              program, as well as the first domestic worker martial arts performance in Hong Kong.
