      "Hey y'all - I'm Justin Kim! I started Kick Action with the vision of making empowerment, through the martial arts, accessible for marginalised communities. As hinted above, the martial arts is an integral part of my life: I've been internationally competing in Olympic-style Taekwondo for almost 10 years and am an active, licensed World Taekwondo Headquarters Master. Even since Jake Paul knocked Ben Askren out, I've been working on boxing too. Other than the martial arts, I love Debate, Basketball, and Taylor Swift!",
